# freeRTOS_atmega328PB_examples

as I work through the freeRTOS book I want to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for myself so that I can look back to if I run into problems in the future

Mastering_the_FreeRTOS_Real_Time_Kernel-A_Hands-On_Tutorial_Guide.pdf

this assumes that freeRTOS is downloaded  
the AVR_ATmega328PB_Xplained_mini_GCC is being used in atmel studio
